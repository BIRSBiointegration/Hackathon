# Multi-omics studies
*We provide easy access to our three multi-omics studies at the following links*.

## Gastrulation scNMT-seq data 
Three omics and more on 826 matching single cells, see the [scNMT-seq folder](https://github.com/BIRSBiointegration/Hackathon/tree/master/scNMT-seq) which contains a README file and guidelines (including a list of challenges to tackle, plus more if you wish to help out).

## Cortex seq-FISH data
Two omics with ~1600 single cells each and 113 matched genes, see the [Data folder seqFISH](https://github.com/BIRSBiointegration/Hackathon/tree/master/seqFISH) that contains a README and challenges to address. Links to additional data are included, if you want to explore further. 

## Single-cell proteomic data
Two targeted proteomic studies investigating the tumor-immune microenvironment in breast cancer patients using different technologies (mass cytometry and MIBI-TOF), see the [Data folder sc-targeted-proteomics](https://github.com/BIRSBiointegration/Hackathon/tree/master/sc-targeted-proteomics) which contains a README and more details on the data, with some questions to begin exploring.
