# Code of Conduct
[Mathematical Frameworks for Integrative Analysis of Emerging Biological Data Types (20w5197)](https://www.birs.ca/events/2020/5-day-workshops/20w5197).  Banff International Research Station, Banff, June 14 to June 19, 2020. 

The Mathematical Frameworks for Integrative Analysis of Emerging Biological Data Types meeting aims to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment
We are dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

* Gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
* Intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software preferences, coding experience or style, scientific perspective, etc.

We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying online, pre-meeting communication (email, slack, in person, etc), during the hackathon, in talks, workshops, poster sessions, social activities. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the hackathon and meeting  at the discretion of the organizers. 

## Enforcement
Participants will be asked to stop any harassing or intimidating behavior and comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon and meeting.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules online, during communication on social media, slack, email and at all event venues and event-related social activities. 
 
## Reporting
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.
You can make a report either personally or anonymously.


### Anonymous or Non-anonymous Report
You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report by filling this [form](https://forms.gle/PSiZLBxUsTpPt1Xk9).  It is a free-form text box that will be forwarded to conference organizers.

We can’t follow up on an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

### Personal Report
You can make a personal report with any of the conference anti-harassment committee: Aedin Culhane, Elana Fertig, Kim-Anh Lê Cao or to BIRS staff.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
 
## Social media policy
Images and content from talks, workshops, and posters may be shared publicly through social media unless the presenter asks for it not to be. To avoid confusion, presentations not to be shared should be labeled “**Do Not Share**” on each slide, as should be posters.  
Slides can be shared publicly on the BIRS website at https://www.birs.ca/organizers/publishing-slides.
